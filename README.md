# Expense Tracker Backend

This is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) backend for an Expense Tracker, built with [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

## Getting Started

First, activate the virtual environment and run the server:

```bash
# On Linux
source venv/bin/activate  

# On Windows: 
venv\Scripts\activate

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Use [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) `curl` to see the API in action.

Or open [http://localhost:8000/api/v1](http://localhost:8000/api/v1)

You can start editing the endpoints by modifying `main.py`. The server auto-reloads as you edit the file.
